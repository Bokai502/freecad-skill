# Simulation Skill

Use this skill for model thermal simulation work driven by:

```bash
python -m sim_cli_tools.cli.main
```

The tool reads an existing workspace with `00_inputs` and `01_cad`, then writes simulation through analysis outputs under `02_sim`.

## Core Rules

- Use `python -m sim_cli_tools.cli.main` as the first-class entry point. The installed `sim-run` wrapper is an alias for the same module. Do not call copied runtime modules directly unless debugging internals.
- Resolve the workspace from the Open Codex Web execution context `workspace_dir`. Workspace/version selection is request-scoped; `/api/run`, checkout, and branch do not update `/data/lbk/codex_web/config.json`.
- Always pass the execution context workspace explicitly with `--workspace-dir <workspace_dir>` for `doctor` and `run`. Do not rely on `config.json`, process `cwd`, or CLI defaults.
- Before running `run`, inspect the selected workspace by running `--json doctor --workspace-dir <workspace_dir>`. If the reported `workspace_dir` differs from the prompt `workspace_dir`, stop and report the mismatch instead of running simulation into the wrong workspace.
- Required inputs live under:
  - `<workspace>/00_inputs/real_bom.json`
  - `<workspace>/00_inputs/layout_topology.json`
  - `<workspace>/00_inputs/geom.json`
  - `<workspace>/01_cad/geometry_after.step`
  - `<workspace>/01_cad/geometry_after.geom.json`
  - `<workspace>/01_cad/geometry_after.layout_topology.json`
  - `<workspace>/01_cad/geometry_after_registry.json`
  - `<workspace>/01_cad/simulation_input.json`
  - `<workspace>/01_cad/comsol_inputs/coord.txt`
  - `<workspace>/01_cad/comsol_inputs/channels_input.npz`
- Real COMSOL runs always start a private mphserver. Reusing an existing mphserver is not supported by this tool.
- Use `comsol_local` for real thermal simulation.
- After a successful simulation, COMSOL/ParaView GUI loaders open by default. Use `--no-open-tools` only for headless runs.
- Do not delete or recreate the workspace unless the user explicitly asks.

## Commands

Show help:

```bash
python -m sim_cli_tools.cli.main --help
python -m sim_cli_tools.cli.main run --help
```

Check whether inputs are complete:

```bash
python -m sim_cli_tools.cli.main \
  --json doctor \
  --workspace-dir <workspace_dir>
```

Real local COMSOL run:

```bash
python -m sim_cli_tools.cli.main \
  --json run \
  --workspace-dir <workspace_dir> \
  --simulation-backend comsol_local \
  --mph-port 32036 \
  --force \
  --quiet
```

Headless run without opening COMSOL/ParaView GUI tools:

```bash
python -m sim_cli_tools.cli.main \
  --json run \
  --workspace-dir <workspace_dir> \
  --simulation-backend comsol_local \
  --mph-port 32036 \
  --force \
  --quiet \
  --no-open-tools
```

## Outputs To Inspect

After a run, inspect:

- `<workspace>/logs/progress_percentages.json`
- `<workspace>/logs/pipeline.log`
- `<workspace>/logs/simulation_run_stage_result.json`
- `<workspace>/02_sim/run_manifest.json`
- `<workspace>/02_sim/simulation/status.json`
- `<workspace>/02_sim/simulation/simulation_manifest.json`
- `<workspace>/02_sim/simulation/data1.txt`
- `<workspace>/02_sim/simulation/native.vtu`
- `<workspace>/02_sim/simulation/component_face_temperature.json`
- `<workspace>/02_sim/postprocess/temperature_field_threejs.json`
- `<workspace>/02_sim/postprocess/render_summary.json`
- `<workspace>/02_sim/case_build/component_index.json`
- `<workspace>/02_sim/analysis/metrics_summary.json`

For real COMSOL progress during simulation, also inspect:

- `<workspace>/02_sim/simulation/_comsol_work/sim/status.json`
- `<workspace>/02_sim/simulation/_comsol_work/sim/comsol_progress.json`

## Progress Semantics

`logs/progress_percentages.json` is the top-level progress document:

- `status: running|success|failed`
- `overall_percent` is weighted across simulation, field export, postprocess, case build, and analysis.
- The `simulation` step may include `comsol_progress` for COMSOL runs.
- `comsol_progress.stage` describes the current COMSOL stage, such as `prepare_mph`, `update_geometry`, `prepare_mesh`, `solve`, `export`, `postprocess`, or `completed`.
- `comsol_progress.heartbeat_at` indicates that a long-running stage such as `solve` is still alive even if percent is unchanged.

## Triage

1. Run `doctor` first when inputs or workspace are uncertain.
2. If `doctor` reports missing files, stop and report the exact missing paths.
3. If a stale lock blocks a run, use `--force` only when the recorded PID is not alive.
4. If a real COMSOL run appears stuck, inspect `progress_percentages.json`, `_comsol_work/sim/comsol_progress.json`, and `_comsol_work/sim/status.json` before killing processes.
5. Check active processes with:

```bash
pgrep -af "sim_run.py|comsol_remote_entry.py|mphserver"
```

6. If `mph-port` is busy, keep the requested port unless the runtime chooses the next free private port automatically.
7. After any failed run, inspect `logs/pipeline.log` and `logs/simulation_run_stage_result.json` before rerunning.

## Expected Success Criteria

A successful full run has:

- `02_sim/run_manifest.json` with `ok: true`.
- `logs/progress_percentages.json` with `status: success` and `overall_percent: 100.0`.
- `simulation_run`, `field_export`, `postprocess`, `case_build`, and `analysis` stages completed.
- For real COMSOL, `02_sim/simulation/status.json` has `ok: true` and real artifacts such as `data1.txt`, `native.vtu`, and `work.mph`.
